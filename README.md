# SQL Insights and Queries
---
This section continues the analysis from the Excel portion of the project by leveraging SQL to extract deeper insights from the data. The queries below address key business questions suchs as product performance, customer behaviour, and regional sales contribution.
Using SQL allows us to efficiently:
- Retrieve total sales per product category.
- Identify the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
- Calculate total revenue,monthly sales trends, and more.
  
The queries and thier corresponding results are documented below.

 ### 1. Retrieve the Total Sales for Each Product Category
 ---
#### Objective:
 To determine the total sales revenue generated by each product category. This helps in understanding which product categories perform the best.

``` SQL
Select
Product,
SUM(CAST(Quantity AS INT) * CAST(UnitPrice AS DECIMAL(18,2))) AS TotalSales
FROM
[SalesDB].[dbo].[Lita Capstone project sales data]
GROUP BY
PRODUCT;
```

#### Explanation: 
1. CAST(Quantity AS INT):
- Converts the quantity column into an integer data type to ensure consistent calcualations.
2. CAST(UnitPrice AS DECIMAL(18,2);
- Converts the UnitPrice column into a decimal with 18 digits in totol, including 2 digits after the decimal point, ensuring precision for monetary values.
3. SUM(CAST(Quantity AS INT) * CAST(UnitPrice AS DECIMAL(18,2))):
- Mutlplies Quantity by UnitPrice for each record to calculate the sales for that transaction.
- The SUM function aggregates these values to compute the total sales for each product.
4. GROUP BY Product:
- Groups the data by the Product column so that the total sales are calcualted for each product individually.
  
#### Result:
The query returns a list of products along with their respective total sales values, helping to understand the revenue generated by each product.

### 2.Find the Number of Sales Transaction in Each Region
---
#### Objective:
To count the total number of sales transactions conducted in each region.

``` SQL
SELECT
Region,
COUNT(OrderID) AS NUMBEROFSALESTRANSACTION
FROM [SalesDB].[dbo].[Lita Capstone project sales data]
GROUP BY Region;
```

#### Explanation:
1. COUNT(OrderID):
- Counts the total number of sales transactions based on the OrderID column. Each transaction is represented by a unique OrderID.

2.Group BY Region:
- Groups the data by the Region column, ensuring that the count is calculated for each region seperately.
#### Result:
The query outputs the number of sales transactions for each region as follows:
- ##### North: 2481
- ##### East: 2483
- ##### South: 2480
- ##### West: 2477

This anlysis provides insights into the distribution of sales activities across different regions, which can be useful for decision-making, resource allocation, or identifying prformance trends.

### 3. Find the Highest-Selling Product by Total Sales Value
---
#### Objective:
To determine the product that generated the highest total sales revenue.

``` SQL
SELECT TOP 1
Product,
SUM(CAST(Quantity AS INT) * CAST(UnitPrice AS DECIMAL(18,2))) AS TotalSales
FROM [SalesDB].[dbo].[Lita Capstone project sales data]
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

#### Explanation:
1. SUM(CAST(Quantity AS INT) * CAST(UnitPrice AS DECIMAL(18,2))):
- Calculates the total sales revenue by multiplying the Quantity of items sold by their UnitPrice.
-  CAST is used to ensure proper data types for calculations (e.g, converting Quantity to INT and UnitPrice to a decimal with two decimal places).
2. GROUP BY Product:
- Groups the data by each product to calculate the total sales for each one.
3. SELECT TOP 1..... ORDER BY TotalSales DESC:
- Retrieves only the product with the highest total sales by sorting in descending order of TotalSales.

#### Result:
- ##### Product: Shoes
- ##### TotalSales; N613,380.00

This result identifies the product that is contributing the most to revenue, providing key insights for inventory and marketing strategies.

### 4. Calculate Total Revenue Per Product
---
#### Objective:
To calculate the total revenue generated by each product.

``` SQL
select
Product,
SUM(CAST(Quantity AS INT) * CAST(UnitPrice AS DECIMAL(18,2))) AS TotalRevenue
FROM [SalesDB].[dbo].[Lita Capstone project sales data]
GROUP BY Product;
```
<img width="955" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17fd18f0-657d-46d8-8bfd-d371588e839e" />

#### Explanation:
1.SUM(CAST(Quantity AS INT) * CAST(UnitPrice AS DECIMAL(18,2))):
- Computes the total revenue for each product.
- Quantity is cast as an integer and multiplied by UnitPrice cast as a decimal for accurate calculations.
2.GROUP BY PRODUCT:
- Groups the data by each unique product to calculate its corresponding revenue.

#### Result:

|Product|TotalRevenue (N)|
|-------|----------------|
|Shoes  |613,380.00      |
|Jacket |208,320.00      |

```
<img width="957" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9340123-fa5f-460c-88f5-2535e850b22d" />

#### Explanation:
1. YEAR(OrderDate) and YEAR(OrderDate):
- Extract the year and motn from OrderDate column.
2. SUM(CAST(Quantity AS INT) * CAST(UnitPrice AS DECIMAL(18,2))):
- Calculates the totla monthly sales by multiplying the quantity sold by the unit price.
3.WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2024:
- Filters the data to include only orders from the year 2024.
4. GROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate), MONTH(OrderDate):
- GROUPS the data by year and month to calculate the monthly sales.
5. ORDER BY YEAR, MONTH;
- Ensures the results are ordered sequentially by year and month.

#### Result:
