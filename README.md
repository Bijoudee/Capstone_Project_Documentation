# Lita Capstone Project Documentation

### Project Overview
---
This repository showcases my capstone project, which centers on Sales Performance Analysis for a retail store and Customer Segmentation for a subscription service. The project is divided into two primary sections, employing Excel, SQL, and Power BI for thorough data analysis and visualization.

### Project Status
---
- Project 1: Sales Performance Anaysis (Excel Completed)
- Project 2: Customer Segmentation (In Progress)
  
 ### Project 1: Sales Performance Analysis for a retail Store
 ---
  ### Current Implementation (Excel)

  ### Objective
  ---
  Analyze sales performance data to identify trend, patterns and key performance indicators for a retail store.

   ### Tools Used
   ---
   - Microsoft Excel: Used for data cleaning, preliminary analysis and basic visualizations.
  - SQL: To query, clean, and prepare data for analysis
  -  Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

### Analysis Performed
---
- Pivot tables  to summarize total sales by product, region and month.
- Using Excel formulas to calculate average sales per product and total revenue by region.
- Generating additional insightful reports using charts.

### Key Insights from Excel Analysis
---
- Total Sales: Summarized Total revenue from sales transactions.
- Average Sales Per Product: Computed to understand product performance
- Regional Performance: Identified regions with the highest sales

  ### Data Visualization
 ---
 - Total Sales by Product, Region and Month.

### SQL Insights and Queries
---
This section continues the analysis from the Excel portion of the project by leveraging SQL to extract deeper insights from the data. The queries below address key business questions suchs as product performance, customer behaviour, and regional sales contribution.
Using SQL allows us to efficiently:
- Retrieve total sales per product category.
- Identify the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
- Calculate total revenue,monthly sales trends, and more.
  
The queries and thier corresponding results are documented below.

 ## 1. Retrieve the Total Sales for Each Product Category
 Objective:
 To determine the total sales revenue generated by each product category. This helps in understanding which product categories perform the best.
 SQL Query:

Select
Product,
SUM(CAST(Quantity AS INT) * CAST(UnitPrice AS DECIMAL(18,2))) AS TotalSales
FROM
[SalesDB].[dbo].[Lita Capstone project sales data]
GROUP BY
PRODUCT;

## Explanation: 
1. CAST(Quantity AS INT):
- Converts the quantity column into an integer data type to ensure consistent calcualations.
2. CAST(UnitPrice AS DECIMAL(18,2);
- Converts the UnitPrice column into a decimal with 18 digits in totol, including 2 digits after the decimal point, ensuring precision for monetary values.
3. SUM(CAST(Quantity AS INT) * CAST(UnitPrice AS DECIMAL(18,2))):
- Mutlplies Quantity by UnitPrice for each record to calculate the sales for that transaction.
- The SUM function aggregates these values to compute the total sales for each product.
4. GROUP BY Product:
- Groups the data by the Product column so that the total sales are calcualted for each product individually.
  
## Result:
The query returns a list of products along with their respective total sales values, helping to understand the revenue generated by each product.

## 2.Find the Number of Sales Transaction in Each Region
Objective:
To count the total number of sales transactions conducted in each region.

SQL Query:
SELECT
Region,
COUNT(OrderID) AS NUMBEROFSALESTRANSACTION
FROM [SalesDB].[dbo].[Lita Capstone project sales data]
GROUP BY Region;

## Explanation:
1. COUNT(OrderID):
- Counts the total number of sales transactions based on the OrderID column. Each transaction is represented by a unique OrderID.

2.Group BY Region:
- Groups the data by the Region column, ensuring that the count is calculated for each region seperately.
## Result:
The query outputs the number of sales transactions for each region as follows:
- ## North: 2481
- ## East: 2483
- ## South: 2480
- ## West: 2477

This anlysis provides insights into the distribution of sales activities across different regions, which can be useful for decision-making, resource allocation, or identifying prformance trends.
